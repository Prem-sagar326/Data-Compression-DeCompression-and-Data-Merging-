Our Project consists of two things

1)Data compression and DeCompression

2)Data Merging


For Data Compression and DeCompression

We used LZW method for the compression and decompression which consist binaryin and binaryout to convert the existing into bin file which compressed 50% of the data ie. data excel sheet that we have converted to compressed.bin and again using that compressed file we decompresed and then restored the data from binary

For Data Merging

We used MultiWay Merging to merge the dataset. We took 2 excel named csv1 and csv2, mergered them into merged.csv file
