Our Project consists of two things

1)Data compression and DeCompression

Algo: LZW(Lempel–Ziv–Welch)

Data Set: Economy of diffrent contries

2)Data Merging

Algo: MultiWay Merge 

Data Set: Financial Transactions 

For Data Compression and DeCompression

Code Files: LZW, BinaryIn, BinaryOut, TST

Input File for Compression: Data.csv

Output File for Compression: Compressed.Bin

Input for DeCompression: Compressed.bin

Output for DeCompression: DeCompressed.csv

We used LZW method for the compression and decompression which consist binaryin and binaryout to convert the existing into bin file which compressed 50% of the data ie. data excel sheet that we have converted to compressed.bin and again using that compressed file we decompresed and then restored the data from binary

For Data Merging

Code File

We used MultiWay Merging to merge the dataset. We took 2 excel named csv1 and csv2, mergered them into merged.csv file
